## Overview

**NEXUS (NetMapper Pro)** is a high-performance desktop application that combines multi-protocol network scanning, interactive topology mapping, continuous background monitoring, and security analysis into a single unified tool. It is designed for network administrators, cybersecurity analysts, and IT professionals who need real-time visibility into their local network.

The application performs Layer-2 (ARP) and Layer-3 (ICMP) host discovery, probes TCP services, resolves DNS hostnames, identifies device vendors via MAC OUI lookup, fingerprints operating systems via TTL analysis, and enriches data via SNMP and mDNS passive discovery — all within seconds. Scan results are persisted in an encrypted SQLite database, visualized on an interactive topology graph, and continuously monitored for changes.

## Key Features

### 1. 🔍 Network Discovery & Scanning

| Capability                  | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active ARP Scanning**     | Layer-2 host discovery using raw ARP packets via `pnet`. Detects all devices on the local subnet even if ICMP is blocked.                                       |
| **ICMP Ping Probing**       | Measures round-trip latency (RTT) and captures TTL values for OS fingerprinting. Runs in parallel with ARP for speed.                                           |
| **TCP Port Probing**        | Scans 20+ common service ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, Telnet, FTP, RDP, SMB, DNS, MQTT, etc.) to detect running services.                                           |
| **DNS Hostname Resolution** | Reverse DNS lookup for all discovered hosts to resolve human-readable hostnames.                                                                                |
| **MAC Vendor Lookup**       | Identifies device manufacturers using the IEEE OUI database (`mac_oui` crate). Detects randomized/locally-administered MAC addresses.                           |
| **OS Fingerprinting**       | Guesses the operating system (Windows, Linux/macOS, Network Device) based on ICMP TTL values.                                                                   |
| **Device Type Inference**   | Automatically classifies devices as Router, Switch, Server, PC, Mobile, IoT, Printer, or Unknown based on vendor, hostname, open ports, and gateway heuristics. |
| **SNMP Enrichment**         | Optional SNMPv2c polling for system description, hostname, uptime, and LLDP/CDP neighbor discovery for topology mapping.                                        |
| **Passive mDNS Discovery**  | Listens for Multicast DNS (Bonjour/Avahi) service announcements to discover devices without active probing.                                                     |
| **Passive ARP Monitoring**  | Captures ARP traffic passively to detect new devices joining the network in real time.                                                                          |
| **Risk Score Calculation**  | Computes a 0–100 risk score per device based on device type, open ports, and MAC randomization status.                                                          |

### 2. 📡 Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts

| Capability                  | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Background Monitor Loop** | Configurable interval-based scanning (default: every 60 seconds) that runs in the background via an async Tokio task.                         |
| **Device Lifecycle Events** | Detects and emits events for: **New Device**, **Device Offline**, **Device Back Online**, **IP Address Changed**, and **Open Port Detected**. |
| **Live Event Emission**     | Pushes monitor events to the frontend in real time via Tauri's event system (`monitor-event` channel).                                        |
| **Alert Persistence**       | All alerts are saved to the SQLite database with timestamps, severity levels, and device associations.                                        |
| **Alert Deduplication**     | Smart dedupe logic prevents repeated alerts for the same event within a configurable time window using composite dedupe keys.                 |
| **Unread/Read Workflow**    | Alerts have read/unread status. Users can mark individual alerts as read, mark all as read, or clear all alerts.                              |
| **Idempotent Start**        | Starting the monitor when it's already running is a no-op, preventing duplicate monitoring loops.                                             |
| **Auto-Start Integration**  | Monitor can be configured to auto-start on application launch via the Settings page.                                                          |

## Requirements

### Common

- **Rust** toolchain (stable, 2021 edition)
- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
- **Tauri v2 CLI** (`npm install @tauri-apps/cli`)

### Windows

- [Npcap](https://npcap.com/) installed (recommended with WinPcap compatibility mode)
- Visual Studio Build Tools (MSVC C++ toolchain)
- Run as **Administrator** for raw packet access

### Linux

- `libpcap-dev` and standard build tools (`build-essential`)
- `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libayatana-appindicator3-dev` (for Tauri)

### macOS

- `libpcap` (typically pre-installed or via Homebrew)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

---

## Quick Start

### Development (Full Desktop App)

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm --prefix ui ci

# Launch Tauri dev mode (backend + frontend hot-reload)
npm --prefix ui run tauri dev
```

### Frontend Only (No Backend)

```bash
npm --prefix ui run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:1420
```

### CLI Scanner (Standalone)

```bash
cargo run
# Outputs scan results as JSON to stdout
```

---

## Build

### Production Desktop Build

```bash
cd ui
npm run tauri build
```

This produces platform-specific installers:

- **Windows**: `.msi` (WiX) and `.exe` (NSIS)
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` and `.deb`
- **macOS**: `.dmg` and `.app`

### Frontend Only Build

```bash
npm --prefix ui run build
```

---

## Verification Commands

Run from the repository root:

```bash
# Rust checks
cargo check --all-targets          # Type checking
cargo clippy --all-targets         # Linting
cargo test --all-targets           # Unit tests
cargo test --test alerts_dedupe_integration  # Integration test

# Frontend build
npm --prefix ui run build

# Tauri environment check
npm --prefix ui run tauri info
```

---

## Runtime Logs

Logs are written to your local app data directory:

| OS      | Path                                            |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\netmapper\logs\`  |
| Linux   | `~/.local/share/netmapper/logs/`                |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/netmapper/logs/` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No valid interface found" when pressing Start Scan

**Common causes:**

- Npcap not installed or not configured for WinPcap compatibility
- Application not running with Administrator/root privileges
- Virtual adapter presenting placeholder data (`0.0.0.0/0`)

**Solutions:**

1. Confirm Npcap is installed with WinPcap compatibility mode.
2. Run the app as **Administrator** (Windows) or with `sudo` (Linux/macOS).
3. Disable unused virtual adapters (VPN, Docker, Hyper-V).
4. Ensure your active NIC has a valid IPv4 address.

### Repeated scan/monitor log spam

- Monitor start is idempotent, but stale dev processes can overlap.
- Stop all previous `tauri dev` sessions before restarting.

### Build fails on Windows

- Ensure Npcap SDK is available (the `build.rs` script searches common install paths).
- Verify MSVC build tools are installed.

---

## CI/CD

The project uses **GitHub Actions** with `tauri-action` for automated cross-platform builds:

- **Trigger**: Push a version tag (`v*`) to create a release.
- **Platforms**: Windows (x64), Linux (x64), macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon).
- **Artifacts**: Installers are automatically uploaded to the GitHub Release.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history and notable updates.
